                <h4>What exactly is a live-in landlord?</h4>
                <p>Simply put, a 'live-in landlord' or 'resident landlord', is someone that rents out part of their home, while also living in the property.</p>

                <h4>As a homeowner, do I need permission to let out part of my house?</h4>
                <p>If you own the property outright, no special permissions are needed. If you have an outstanding mortgage, you need to have a quick check in with your lender. Most mortgage agreements allow you to take in a lodger as long as you live in the property.</p>

                <h4>I don't own my house. Can a lodger live with me?</h4>
                <p>If you are a secure council tenant, you are allowed to sublet part of the property - as long as you have the council's permission first! Private tenants are generally prohibited from subletting but checking your contract or chatting to your landlord will be able to clarify this for you.</p>
